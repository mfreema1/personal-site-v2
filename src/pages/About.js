                            <p>I grew up on a farm in New Tripoli, Pennsylvania.  In rural PA, there's not too much to do unless you're interested in the usual stuff -- tractors, farming, hunting, etc.  I got into woodworking and machinery early on, but not much of the other stuff.</p>

                            <p>I later moved to Allentown and eventually graduated high school there.  I had picked up an appreciation for heavy machinery and physics from my time on the farm, so I decided to attend Stevens Institute of Technology majoring in Mechanical Engineering.</p>
                            
                            <h4 class="bolded body-font">Out of the Frying Pan</h4>
                            <p>Through some pretty incredible professors, I got to see my first line of code, and eventually switched majors to Software Engineering.  I immersed myself as much as possible off the bat -- doing hackathons, joining a startup, and taking online courseware to sharpen my skills.</p>

                            <p>This taught me quite a bit about programming, but most importantly, I learned how to teach myself.  Nowadays, I spend my time looking at DevOps, cloud computing, and Agile methodologies.  I also write programs in my free time, and try to pick up new tools whenever possible.</p>
                            
                            <h4 class="bolded body-font">Looking Forward</h4>
                            <p>There's still a ton left to learn -- in the meantime, I'm just trying to make things that help people.  I tend to switch projects fairly frequently, but the ones I'm working on right now are:</p>
