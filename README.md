<h1>My Website (A Learning Experience)</h1>
<p>This is actually my second attempt at making a website.  For my first attempt, I didn't quite have an understanding of the web.  This time around, I'm doing a little bit better, so figured I'd give it a go.  This is the result.<p>

<h3>Why Make a Website?</h3>
<p>Well, now that I have a domain, I can host almost whatever I want up here!  I wouldn't be surprised if I started some kind of portfolio or blog to be honest.  The possibilities are endless.<p>

Side note:  If you're reading this page on the [GitHub](https://github.com/mfreema1/personal-site-v2), then you'll be seeing this as just plain-old markdown.  But, if you're on my [website](http://mrkfrmn.com), then you'll be viewing this page as HTML.  This is done using [Marked](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked), which is a markdown parser that can be used to generate HTML.  Neat!

<h3>Technology Used</h3>
As mentioned above, this was really just to try my hand at some new tech.  I wanted to give React a shot, as well as some new npm packages that I thought were cool.  In total, this website uses:

- Build:
    - Babel
    - Webpack
    - Marked (generating this page)
- Languages:
    - JS (ES6)
    - Hints of HTML and CSS
- Frameworks:
    - React
    - Bootstrap via Reactstrap

In the future:
- Express
- Deployment
