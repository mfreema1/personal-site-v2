# My Personal Website (A Learning Experience)
This is actually my second attempt at making a website.  For my first attempt, I didn't quite have an understanding of the web.  This time around, I'm doing a little bit better, so figured I'd give it a go.  This is the result.

## Technology Used
As mentioned above, this was really just to try my hand at some new tech.  I wanted to give React/Redux a shot, as well as some new npm packages that I thought were cool.  In total, this website uses:

- Build:
    - Babel
    - Webpack
    - Marked (generating this page)
- Languages:
    - JS (ES6)
    - Hints of HTML and CSS
- Frameworks:
    - React
    - Bootstrap via Reactstrap

In the future:
- Express
- NGINX?
